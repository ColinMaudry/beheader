# beheader 0.12.0

Script that retrieves a list of [dcat:Distribution](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#Class:_Distribution) (file metadata) from a SPARQL endpoint and uses their URL to retrieve some information:

* size
* media type
* availability

The information is stored as RDF and uploaded to the same triple store as for the DCAT metadata, but in a different graph.

It's called the beheader because the data admins get beheaded when the script reports the number of unavailable files (errors 404, 500)

Sample Turtle RDF output:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://colin.maudry.com/ontologies/dgfr#>.
@prefix dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#> .

<https://www.data.maudry.com/fr/resources/ff91442b-4916-4567-ab87-e5a6fe6254b6>
	:responseStatusCode "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" ;
	dgfr:available true ;
	dcat:byteSize 29 ;
	dcat:mediaType "text/html" .
```

## Requirements

This bash script is designed to work on Unix systems.

You need the following utilities installed

* curl
* iconv

## Configuration

1. Make a copy of `config_template.sh`
2. Rename it `config.sh`
3. Configure as you please

It's preconfigured to upload to http://www.data.maudry.com, but you need the credentials to write there. So to upload somewhere else you need to modify `ENDOINT_URL` to match the base URL of your RDF repository.

### 0.12.0

* 2xx and 3xx codes assume the file is available
* Switched back to HEAD to enable certain servers to have adequate response. If unsupported, automatic switch to GET
* Configurable timeout (waiting time after which you consider the resource is not available)

### 0.11.0

* Switched to `curl -X GET -I` since it doesn't download the file and has better support from servers
* Added inference of availability. If status is not `200 OK` then `dgfr:available false`

#### 0.10.1

* Improved cURL command for faster and more robust retrieval of HTTP headers (removed Inspire URL hack)
* Possibility to specify the name of the target graph

### 0.10

* `iconv` -c Serializes the resulting TTL files to UTF-8 to remove encoding errors (loss of data :( )
* & signs in URLs are better supported
* Either upload data by small batches of 5 distributions, or a single shot at the end
* Inspire URL have a more flexible timeout...

###Â 0.9

* Lists all dcat:Distribution referenced on data.gouv.fr, by ascending creation date
* For each file:
	1. checks availability and store HTTP response (200 OK, 400 Not found or 500 Server error)
	2. checks and store Content-Type returned by the server
	3. checks and store Content-length returned by the server
